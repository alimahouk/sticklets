STICKLETS 1.0.1 RELEASE NOTES | December 2016
—
NEW:
• Sticklets now sits in your menu bar rather than on your dock.
• ⌘S shrinks the current note to fit its text if the note is too big for the currently typed text. This helps keep your desktop clean.
• Option-click the menu bar icon to quickly create a new note.
• Links are now clickable.

FIXES:
• Fixed a bug where notes wouldn’t close on Macs that don’t have a Touch Bar.

Enjoy!
